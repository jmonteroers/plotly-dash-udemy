# Chapter 2. Introduction to Data Basics

Matplotlib and seaborn offer static plots (images).

Plotly is both a company and an open-source library. The company released the
library in several languages. The version in Python is the most popular.

Plotly creates interactive plots as html files. While users can interact with
these plots (zoom in, select...), these plots can't be connected to changing
data sources.

Dash is useful to have interactive plots that update in real time!
